# top 100 most listened to songs
This Python script uses the Spotify API to retrieve the user's top 100 most listened to songs and top 100 most listened artists.

The user needs to provide their Spotify credentials and register a new application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret. The script then uses the credentials to authenticate with the Spotify API and retrieve the user's top tracks data
